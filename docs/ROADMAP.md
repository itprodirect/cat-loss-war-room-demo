# Roadmap (Simple, Current)

Last updated: March 6, 2026

This is the short version. Clean, practical, no drama.

## Where we are now

- Demo pipeline is stable.
- 109 tests are passing.
- CI has a fresh-environment gate plus `exa-py` compatibility matrix.
- A deeper V2 foundation layer is now tracked in issues `#22` through `#27`.
- Issue [#4](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/4) is complete.
- Issue [#5](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/5) is complete and closed.
- Issue [#6](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/6) is in progress (slices 1-3 merged in PR #21).

## Now (next 2-3 weeks)

Goal: lock the shape of V2 and finish the technical foundation.

- [#24](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/24) Define canonical evidence graph and audit schema
- [#27](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/27) Define quality rubric and release scorecard
- [#6](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/6) Complete remaining typed domain contracts
- [#7](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/7) Retrieval provider abstraction + contract tests
- [#8](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/8) Multi-jurisdiction fixture suite + snapshots
- [#9](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/9) Expand CI quality gates

## Next (30-60 days)

Goal: build the first true product workflow around the research engine.

- [#10](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/10) API orchestrator with graceful degradation
- [#11](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/11) Guided web intake + run status UX
- [#12](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/12) Evidence normalization + provenance
- [#13](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/13) Caselaw quality v2
- [#25](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/25) AI guardrails + eval harness
- [#26](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/26) Human review workflow

## Then (60-90 days)

Goal: trust, polish, and real-world adoption readiness.

- [#14](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/14) Citation verification hardening
- [#15](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/15) Memo workspace v2
- [#16](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/16) Firm memory v1
- [#17](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/17) Observability + cost controls
- [#18](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/18) Security baseline
- [#19](https://github.com/itprodirect/cat-loss-war-room-demo/issues/19) Attorney pilot validation

## Success checks we care about

- Reliability: tests and CI stay green on every PR.
- Trust: every key statement in output can be traced to sources.
- Usability: non-technical users can run intake-to-memo with minimal guidance.
- Quality: fewer noisy results, better case law precision, clearer citation confidence.
- Readiness: releases are scored against the same benchmark rubric used in pilot validation.

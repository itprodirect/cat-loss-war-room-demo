## Session 16 - V2 Rebuild Deep Dive and Roadmap Expansion
Date: 2026-03-06
Status: Complete

- Audited the repo as a product candidate, not just a codebase:
  - read the core docs,
  - inspected all major modules,
  - reviewed CI/workflow setup,
  - ran the cached end-to-end pipeline,
  - and verified `pytest -q` still passes (`109 passed`).
- Rewrote `docs/V2_BLUEPRINT.md` into a more opinionated rebuild plan:
  - current-state scorecard,
  - keep/kill/rewrite guidance,
  - UX verdict and experience blueprint,
  - modular-monolith architecture recommendation,
  - AI guardrails,
  - phased V2 roadmap.
- Expanded planning docs to reflect the deeper V2 foundation layer:
  - `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  - `docs/V2_ISSUE_MAP.md`
- Created new GitHub issues to support the rebuild:
  - `#22` product foundation,
  - `#23` workflow + design system,
  - `#24` canonical evidence graph + audit schema,
  - `#25` AI guardrails + eval harness,
  - `#26` human review workflow,

- Confirmed there were no safe duplicate/stale issues to close outright.
- Tightened active roadmap language to reflect the true work order for the current version.
- Narrowed stale issue scope on GitHub so partially-complete issues no longer read like untouched work:
  - `#6` remaining typed-contract work only,
  - `#9` CI expansion beyond existing gates,
  - `#11` implementation follows `#23`,
  - `#12` implementation follows `#24`.
- Added a best-to-worst ranked priority list to `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

## Session 18 - Issue #22 Product Foundation
Date: 2026-03-06
Status: Complete

- Added editable package metadata with `pyproject.toml` for the existing `src/` layout.
- Added shared runtime bootstrap and typed settings helpers:
  - `src/war_room/bootstrap.py`
  - `src/war_room/settings.py`
  - `src/war_room/__main__.py`
- Regenerated the notebook so it uses the shared bootstrap/settings flow instead of `sys.path` mutation and ad hoc env loading.
- Updated `scripts/seed_cache_samples.py` to use the shared bootstrap path.
- Removed per-file `sys.path` mutation from the test suite and switched CI to package-installed test execution.
- Added foundation verification coverage:
  - `tests/test_settings.py`
  - `tests/test_bootstrap.py`
  - Exa client fallback-to-settings coverage in `tests/test_exa_client.py`
- Added runtime and repo-boundary documentation:
  - `docs/FOUNDATION.md`
  - placeholder `apps/`, `workers/`, and `packages/` directories
- Verification:
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m war_room`
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q` -> `122 passed`

## Session 19 - PR #28 CI Fix
Date: 2026-03-06
Status: Complete

- Inspected failing GitHub Actions runs for PR `#28`.
- Identified one root cause across all three failing checks:
  - editable install step failed in Actions with `BackendUnavailable: Cannot import 'setuptools.build_meta'`
- Updated both workflows to install `setuptools>=69` before `pip install -e . --no-build-isolation`:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/exa-compat-matrix.yml`
- Verification:
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q` -> `122 passed`


## Session 20 - Carrier and Case-Law Quality Hardening
Date: 2026-03-07
Status: Complete

- Tightened carrier-result curation to drop low-value regulator navigation pages and prefer document-like regulatory evidence.
- Tightened case-law filtering to exclude commentary/explainer titles from case slots and prefer legal-host, citation-bearing authorities.
- Added stronger regression coverage in:
  - `tests/test_carrier.py`
  - `tests/test_caselaw.py`
  - `tests/test_caselaw_filter.py`
  - `tests/test_offline_demo_pack.py`
- Curated the committed offline demo fixtures so the sample carrier, caselaw, and citation-check payloads match the higher quality bar.
- Verification:
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/test_carrier.py tests/test_caselaw.py tests/test_caselaw_filter.py tests/test_offline_demo_pack.py -q` -> `39 passed`
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q` -> `122 passed`



## Session 21 - Weather and Citation Quality Hardening
Date: 2026-03-07
Status: Complete

- Tightened weather-result curation to demote generic reference pages, prefer county/report-like sources, and filter navigation-heavy observations.
- Tightened citation spot-check ranking to require citation/name alignment before trusting a hit and to prefer legal-host matches over unrelated official pages.
- Added stronger regression coverage in:
  - `tests/test_weather.py`
  - `tests/test_citation_verify.py`
  - `tests/test_offline_demo_pack.py`
- Curated the committed weather fixture so the offline demo lane reflects the higher relevance bar.
- Verification:
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/test_weather.py tests/test_citation_verify.py tests/test_offline_demo_pack.py -q` -> `34 passed`
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q` -> `128 passed`

## Session 22 - Memo Export Trust-Signal Pass
Date: 2026-03-07
Status: Complete

- Reworked markdown export structure to surface trust signals earlier in the memo.
- Added a top-of-memo trust snapshot with source counts, case counts, and citation-check summary.
- Added review-required flags so module warnings and citation uncertainty are visible before the appendix.
- Tightened section presentation:
  - carrier docs now render as highest-value documents,
  - citation confidence is summarized ahead of case detail,
  - source lists now include source-tier reasons.
- Added regression coverage in:
  - `tests/test_export.py`
  - `tests/test_memo_contracts.py`
- Verification:
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/test_export.py tests/test_memo_contracts.py -q` -> `9 passed`
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q` -> `134 passed`

## Session 23 - Query Plan and Source-Tiering Hardening
Date: 2026-03-07
Status: Complete

- Tightened query-plan specificity so legal and carrier searches carry better domain hints and more matter-specific context.
- Added coverage-issue query deduplication to avoid repeated legal searches from near-duplicate intake phrasing.
- Expanded deterministic source-tier coverage for additional legal and carrier-adjacent domains.
- Switched source badge tokens to stable ASCII labels for cleaner downstream rendering and testing.
- Added regression coverage in:
  - `tests/test_query_plan.py`
  - `tests/test_source_scoring.py`
- Verification:
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests/test_query_plan.py tests/test_source_scoring.py -q` -> `23 passed`
  - `.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -q` -> `134 passed`

## Session 24 - Adapter and Runtime Contract Consistency
Date: 2026-03-07
Status: Complete

- Added canonical intake/query-plan adapters and payload helpers in `src/war_room/models.py`:
  - `adapt_query_plan`
  - `case_intake_to_payload`
  - `query_spec_to_payload`
  - `query_plan_to_payloads`
- Updated runtime module imports so `CaseIntake` now comes from `war_room.models` instead of leaking through `query_plan.py`.
- Tightened render/query-plan boundaries:
  - `render_markdown_memo()` now advertises mixed dict/model inputs across the full memo contract,
  - `format_query_plan()` now normalizes mixed dict/model query payloads before formatting.
- Expanded regression coverage in:
  - `tests/test_models.py`
  - `tests/test_query_plan.py`
  - `tests/test_export.py`
  - refreshed module tests to use the canonical model import path.
- Verification:
  - `$env:PYTHONPATH="src"; python -m pytest -q tests/test_models.py tests/test_query_plan.py tests/test_export.py tests/test_memo_contracts.py tests/test_weather.py tests/test_carrier.py tests/test_caselaw.py` -> `48 passed`
  - `$env:PYTHONPATH="src"; python -m pytest -q` -> `139 passed`

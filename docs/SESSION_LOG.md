## Current Snapshot
Date: 2026-03-04

- Branch baseline: `main` contains PR #20 changes.
- Test status: 81 passing.
- Roadmap source of truth: `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/V2_ISSUE_MAP.md`.
- Next priority: issue #5 (schema alignment), then #6 (typed contracts).

## Session 7 - Documentation Refresh and Roadmap Simplification
Date: 2026-03-04
Status: Complete

- Updated canonical docs to match current state (81 tests, CI gates, issue #4 closed).
- Rewrote `docs/HANDOFF.md` for cleaner onboarding.
- Added `docs/ROADMAP.md` for a plain-language, issue-linked plan.
- Updated `docs/V2_BLUEPRINT.md` and `docs/V2_ISSUE_MAP.md` to reflect completed #4 and next priorities.
- Replaced legacy prompt/checklist docs with current, execution-focused versions.
- Verified repository test suite remains green (`81 passed`).

## Session 8 - Eval Lane Formalization
Date: 2026-03-04
Status: Complete

- Formalized the `eval/` workspace as a tracked project surface.
- Added `eval/README.md` with clear usage and data rules.
- Added a CaseIntake-aligned starter template at `eval/intakes/_template_case_intake.json`.
- Updated `eval/results/README.md` and `.gitignore` behavior for local eval artifacts.
- Linked the live eval lane from README and HANDOFF docs.
- Verification: `pytest -q` -> 81 passed.

## Session 9 - Hardening Pass: Null-Client Safety + Caselaw Precision
Date: 2026-03-05
Status: Complete

- Added graceful null-client fallbacks in weather/carrier/caselaw module entrypoints.
- Modules now prefer cache when available and return structured empty payloads when live retrieval is unavailable.
- Tightened caselaw case-like filtering:
  - citation-only items now require a trusted legal/court host,
  - case-name patterns still pass.
- Softened assertive carrier phrasing to evidence-oriented language.
- Added regression tests for all fallback and filter hardening behavior.
- Updated V2 blueprint note to reference `_template_case_intake.json`.
- Verification: `pytest -q` -> 85 passed.

## Session 10 - Issue #5 Intake Validation and Schema Lock
Date: 2026-03-05
Status: Complete

- Added strict intake ingestion helpers in `src/war_room/query_plan.py`:
  - `validate_case_intake_payload(payload)`
  - `load_case_intake(path)`
  - `IntakeValidationError`
- Enforced canonical schema boundaries:
  - required fields must exist,
  - unknown fields are rejected,
  - no type coercion,
  - `event_date` must be valid `YYYY-MM-DD`,
  - `posture` must be a non-empty list of snake_case tokens.
- Exported intake validation API and schema constants from `war_room.__init__`.
- Added coverage in `tests/test_intake_validation.py` for valid/invalid payloads and JSON ingest errors.
- Updated `eval/README.md` with explicit required/optional fields for both demo and live-eval lanes plus strict validation behavior.
- Updated build checklist to reflect issue #5 completion.
- Verification: `pytest -q` -> 96 passed.

## Session 11 - Issue #6 Slice 1: Typed Intake/Query Models (Pydantic)
Date: 2026-03-05
Status: Complete (slice 1)

- Added `src/war_room/models.py` with initial typed domain models:
  - `CaseIntake` (Pydantic, strict extra-field rejection, field validation)
  - `QuerySpec` (Pydantic, typed query contract)
- Rewired `src/war_room/query_plan.py` to use the typed models for all query planning interfaces.
- Preserved existing `#5` intake loader/validator behavior and error message patterns for compatibility.
- Added `tests/test_models.py` covering model validation and serialization round-trip behavior.
- Added `pydantic==2.11.7` to `requirements.txt` for reproducible typed-model support.
- Verification: `pytest -q` -> 100 passed.

## Session 12 - Issue #6 Slice 2: Typed Module Pack Models + Adapters
Date: 2026-03-05
Status: Complete (slice 2)

- Expanded `src/war_room/models.py` with typed payload contracts for:
  - `WeatherBrief`, `WeatherMetrics`, and `SourceReference`
  - `CarrierDocPack`, `CarrierSnapshot`, and `CarrierDocument`
  - `CaseLawPack`, `CaseIssue`, and `CaseEntry`
- Added adapter helpers for validation + normalized payload dumping:
  - `adapt_weather_brief` / `weather_brief_to_payload`
  - `adapt_carrier_doc_pack` / `carrier_doc_pack_to_payload`
  - `adapt_caselaw_pack` / `caselaw_pack_to_payload`
- Wired weather/carrier/caselaw modules to emit adapter-validated payloads for both empty and assembled responses.
- Added `tests/test_pack_adapters.py` to lock typed adapter behavior and validation failures.
- Verification: `pytest -q` -> 105 passed.

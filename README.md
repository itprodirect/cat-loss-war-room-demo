# CAT-Loss War Room

AI-powered catastrophic insurance loss litigation research tool.
Built for demo at Merlin Law Group.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd cat-loss-war-room-demo
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-deps --no-build-isolation

# Copy env template
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add your EXA_API_KEY (optional — demo runs from cache)

# Run tests
python -m war_room
pytest -q

# Open the notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_case_war_room.ipynb
```

## Dependency Compatibility

This repo currently pins a tested dependency set in `requirements.txt`
for reproducible behavior, including `exa-py==2.0.2`.

`src/war_room/exa_client.py` also includes a version-safe `contents`
payload builder so Exa calls keep working across older/newer `exa-py`
APIs.

## What it does

Given a catastrophic loss case (hurricane, hail, etc.), the war room notebook:

1. **Intake** — Captures case facts (location, date, carrier, policy type, posture)
2. **Query Plan** — Generates 12–18 targeted research queries across three modules
3. **Weather Intel** — Gathers official weather data (.gov sources preferred)
4. **Carrier Playbook** — Finds carrier denial patterns, regulatory actions, rebuttal angles
5. **Case Law** — Searches relevant precedent organized by legal issue
6. **Export** — Produces a structured research memo with source confidence badges

## Jupyter Kernel (required)

The notebook must run against the project venv. Register it once:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e . --no-deps --no-build-isolation
python -m pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name cat-loss-war-room-demo --display-name "cat-loss-war-room-demo (.venv)"
```

Then in JupyterLab select **Kernel → Change Kernel → cat-loss-war-room-demo (.venv)**.

## Offline Demo

No API key needed — cached results are committed in `cache_samples/`.

```bash
# Ensure USE_CACHE=true in .env (the default)
source .venv/bin/activate
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_case_war_room.ipynb
# Run All — should complete in < 10 seconds
```

## Current Status

**V2 product foundation landed:** Core demo pipeline is stable, `122` tests are passing, and CI now enforces:
- Fresh environment install + full test run
- Editable package bootstrap validation
- `exa-py` compatibility matrix (`exa-py==2.0.2` and `exa-py<2`)

Issues `#4`, `#5`, and `#22` are complete, and issue `#6` is underway with slices 1-3 (typed intake/query, module pack adapters, and citation/export contracts).
